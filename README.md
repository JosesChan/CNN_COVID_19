 Convolutional neural network used to detect COVID 19 in the lungs, orginally done in Pytorch but has since been converted into Keras.
 Uses samples from the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD) 1a and 1b datasets
 Model based of one used to detect viral pneumonia.
 
 Requires installation of packages using Python 3.9 (preferably through Anaconda)
 
 Steps to operate:
 Open environment
 Download Covid Positive and Negative files from RICORD 1A and RICORD 1B
 RICORD 1A: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80969742
 RICORD 1B: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80969771
 Extract Covid Positive and Negative files
 Place in the respective folders
